**User Journey / Story 1**
```
User visits site and posts a picture
```
```
As a human being,
so I can store all my pictures somewhere and show them to other humans,
I would like to be able to post a picture and have it be visible on !nstagram.
```
**User Journey / Story 2**
```
User signs in and posts a picture that has their name attached to it
```
```
As a human being with friends,
so that I can show my friends which pictures are mine, and see which pictures are theirs,
I would like to be able to sign up/in to !nstagram and see my username attached to my pictures,
and other users usernames attached to their pictures.
```
**User Journey / Story 3**
```
Non-signed in user cannot access
```
```
As a user with a life outside of !nstagram with some privacy concerns,
So that I can ensure that only signed-up fellow users can view and interact with my photos,
I would like non-users not to be able to access the site.
```
**User Journey / Story 4**
```
Second user signs in and likes a picture from first user
```
```
As a user and amateur photographer,
So that I can see which of my pictures are considered good,
I would like users to be able to tag each others photos as 'liked'.
```
**User Journey / Story 5**
```
User cannot like one photo more than once
```
```
As a user and amateur photographer,
So that I have a more accurate measure of which of my pictures are considered good,
I would like users to be only able to tag a  photos as 'liked' once.
```
**User Journey / Story 6**
```
Any user signs in and comments on a picture from another user
```
```
As a user with friends,
So that our photos can become a conversation,
I would like users to be able add comments to each others photos.
```

**User Journey / Story 7**
```
Any user can unlike photos, delete their comments, or delete their own pictures
```
```
As a user who occasionally changes their mind,
So that I can remove comments, photos or likes that I don't wish others to see anymore,
I would like to be able to unlike photos and delete my comments and photos.
```



Instagram Challenge
===================

## Instructions

* Challenge time: one weekend
* Feel free to use Google, your notes, books, etc., but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

## Task

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!

## How to start

1. Produce some stories, break them down into tasks, and estimate
2. Fork this repo, clone, etc
3. Initialize a new rails project

Remember to proceed in small steps! Getting confused? Make the steps even smaller.

## Code Quality

For linting, you can use the `.rubocop.yml` in this repository (or your own!).
You'll need these gems:

```ruby
gem "rubocop", "0.48.1"
gem "rubocop-rails"
```

You can also lint Javascript, CSS, and ERB — feel free to research this. These
will help you to train yourself to produce cleaner code — and will often alert
you to mistakes or mishaps!
